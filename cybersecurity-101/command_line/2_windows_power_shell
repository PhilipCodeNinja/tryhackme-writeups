## 🚀 Step-by-Step Process

### Task 1: [Introduction] 



### Task 2: [What is PowerShell]
1. Combines CLI and scripting language built on .NET framework
2. object oriented
3. object - item with properties (characteristics) and methods (actions) 

### Task 3: [PowerShell Basics]
1. using remmina to log on to target machine via ssh
2. powershell can be started via command: powershell (in windows CLI - I am guessing after remmina remote login)
3. PS C:\Users\... indicates PS
4. Syntax of PS cmdlets (command-lets):
 - Verb-Noun:
	Get-Content
	Set-Location
	Get-Command - !! Lists all available cmdlets, functions, aliases and scripts that can be executed
	Get-Help - info about cmdlets
	"get-help #cmdlet# -examples" - provides examples
	Get-Alias - lists all aliases available
5. dir is alias for Get-ChildItem, cd is alias for Set-Location, echo - Write-Output
6. Find-Module -Name "Powershell"
	an example of how to download additional m


### Task 4: [Navigating the File System and Working with Files]
1. Linux ls			-> Get-ChildItem -Path		// path is optional
2. Linux cd			-> Set-Location -Path
3. Linux touch(?), mkdir	-> New-Item -Path ... -ItemType "Directory"  // Directory as one example
4. Linux rm,rmdir,del		-> Remove-Item -Path
5. Linux cp			-> Copy-Item -Path ... -Destination
6. Linux mv			-> Move-Item -Path ... -Destination
7. Linux cat(?)			-> Get-Content -Path // gets type of sth
 

### Task 5: [Piping, Filtering, and Sorting Data]
1. Piping: in command-line environments commands can be used as input for another. | is the symbol for that.
eg Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object Length // list of files of directory and then sort them by size.

	Get-ChildItem	- gets the object
	|		- sends them to Sort-Object
	Sort-Object	- sorts
	Length		- Length

- Where-Object - used to filter for specific type
eg Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property "Extension" -eq ".txt"
- Select-Object - used to select specific properties
eg Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name,Length

### Task 6: [System and Network Information]
1. Get-ComputerInfo		- information about machine and so
2. Get-LocalUser		- lists local user accounts
3. Get-NetIPConfiguration	- similar to ipconfig
4. Get-NetIPAdress		- shows details for all configured IP addresses

### Task 7: [Real-Time System Analysis]
1. Get-Process			- provides detailed view of all running processes
2. Get-Service			- status of services of machine, which are running, stopped, paused...
3. Get-NetTCPConnection		- displays current TCP connections
4. Get-FileHash			- generates file hashes (useful for incident response

### Task 8: [Scripting]
1. Invoke-Command		- essential for executing commands on remote system
	- Invoke-Command -Computername ... -Credential ... - Scriptblock {...}
	- ... can be left empty for Credential if no Credential needed
